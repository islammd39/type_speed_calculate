        <h2>What is the difference between localstorage and sessionstorage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Documents local storage object,
                the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
                data gets cleared when the page session ends that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the
                last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing
                or incognito session).
            </li>
            <li>
                Session Storage: Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property.
                The difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.
                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid
                for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is
                open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab
                or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the
                same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original
                tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
                objects.
